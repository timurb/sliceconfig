The code commited by me is untested in its whole.
Please don't run it in production until tested.

 # Put the list of scripts to be installed into packagelists/listname
   Scripts are to be placed in 'packages/' dir and should not contain the ! symbol
 # Run `sliceinstall listname`

So sliceinstall base should produce the same result as install_base.sh

There is 'test' packagelist, see it in packagelists/test to get an example
