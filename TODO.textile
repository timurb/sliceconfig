h1. The TODO list

h2. Things that should be done but require integrated testing

 * SSL certs should be generated by trusted dedicated CA.
 ** It don't have to be worldwide trusted if we are to run intersite SSL connections
 but should be trusted by ourselves to protect from man-in-the-middle attacks
 * bind in all scripts to specific paths (`/{etc,opt}/sliceconfig`) rather than relative (`dirname $0`)
 ** if and when we need to bind to relative paths we'd rather code shell-parameter driven behaviour (`_script_ -f '/path/to/sliceconfig'`)
 * use only signed RPMs -- it protects us from attacker replacing our RPM in our RPM repository
 * package software which we build ourselves on the host into RPM -- helps to update and verify that all installed files are the same that we installed
 ** except gems as they have rather wicked build/install/dependencies system

h2. Things that I think worth to be done but not necessary

 * `scripts/configuration.sh`:
 ** split `copy_file` into several functions
 ** make `copy_file` and `get_value` DRYer
 * download RPMs from network rather than bringing them with ourselvers -- it makes updates easier and we save some diskspace and bandwidth

h2. Just some questions

 * why passenger and not unicorn?
