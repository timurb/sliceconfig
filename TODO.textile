h1. The TODO list

h2. Things that should be done but require integrated testing

 * SSL certs should be generated by trusted dedicated CA.
 ** It don't have to be worldwide trusted if we are to run intersite SSL connections but should be trusted by ourselves to protect from man-in-the-middle attacks
 * bind in all scripts to specific paths (`/{etc,opt}/sliceconfig`) rather than relative (`dirname $0`)
 ** if and when we need to bind to relative paths we'd rather code shell-parameter driven behaviour (`_script_ -f '/path/to/sliceconfig'`)
 * use only signed RPMs -- it protects us from attacker replacing our RPM in our RPM repository
 * package software which we build ourselves on the host into RPM -- helps to update and verify that all installed files are the same that we installed
 ** except gems as they have rather wicked build/install/dependencies system
 * `install/scripts/setup_httpd_passenger.sh` has `exit` command at line 15 so that it does nothing it was supposed to do -- just only copy httpd.conf
 It is a possible cause of https://www.pivotaltracker.com/projects/57704?story_id=5314707


h2. Things that I think worth to be done but not necessary

 * `scripts/configuration.sh`:
 ** split `copy_file` into several functions
 ** make `copy_file` and `get_value` DRYer
 * download RPMs from network rather than bringing them with ourselvers -- it makes updates easier and we save some diskspace and bandwidth
 * svnserve_conf in setup_monit_svnserve.sh is specified with a variable. If we are to change it we'd rather put it somewhere like etc.conf and retrieve its value with get_value()

h2. Just some questions

 * why passenger and not unicorn?

h2. Tasks to do later

 * separate automysqlbackup script from installation `setup_backup.sh` script
 * bundle optimization
